# React To-Do List Application

This is a simple To-Do List application built with React.js. The app allows users to add, edit, complete, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they persist even after a page refresh.

## Features

- **Add New Task:** Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Edit Task:** Users can edit the text of existing tasks.
- **Complete/Undo Task:** Users can mark tasks as completed or undo the completion.
- **Delete Task:** Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage:** The application stores tasks in local storage, so they persist across page refreshes.
